# Strategy Document
Date: Jan 24, 2024
Prepared by: Andrew C.

## Introduction
This document outlines the strategy for performing the statistical and exploratory analysis of New York's Pastry/ Dessert oriented businesses. This document aims to streamline the project process and ensure quality deliverables and time management. This document was drafted *after* the project was completed. However, this document serves as practice for future projects to outline milestones and achievements.

## Plan
#### Establish project scope 
    * Use Yelp's API to uncover hidden trends that increase the likelihood for a business's success.
    * We will define success as the number of reviews and average rating above median value.
    
## Analyze
#### Collect, prepare, analyze data
    * API key was generated through Yelp's developer site.
    * Extract, Transform and Load data into usable formats.
    * Clean, tidy data for usability.

## Construct
#### Model selections and apply machine learning algorithms
    * Apply statistical methods between features of data (business types, spatial clustering)
    * Use methods like Chi2, ANOVA and Tukey to observe relationship/ independence between each feature.
    * Use DBSCAN clustering to observe regions of NYC with higher rates of success.

## Execute
#### Communicate findings to stakeholders and address feedback.
    * Stakeholders are investors with no knowledge of statistics and clustering algorithms.
    * Address shareholder feedback.
    * Draft presentation in a readable/ understandable format.
    * Dashboard findings for ease of access.
    * Address any limitations of analysis.
